## 2) Objects, methods and local variables

### 2.1) Talking to objects

When you want something to be done, you ask an object to do it. Rather than ask in the abstract whether `a` *equals* `b`, you ask `a` whether it considers itself equal to `b`. 

#### 2.1.1) Ruby and onject orientation

In object-oriented programming (OOP), you perform calculations, data manipulation, and input/output operations by creating objects and asking them to perform actions and provide you with information.

In most object-oriented languages, including Ruby, every objectos an example or instance of a particular class, and the behaviour of individual objects is determined at least to some extent by the method definitions present in the object's class.
