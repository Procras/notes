# 3) Organizing objects with classes

Defining a class lets you group behaviours (methods) into convenient bundles, so that you can quickly create many objects that behave essentially the same way. 
 
Everything you handle in Ruby is either an object or a construct that evaluates to an object, and every object is an instance of some class. This fact hold true even where it might first seem a little old. Integres are instances of class, and the classes themselves are objects.
